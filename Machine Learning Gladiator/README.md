# Machine Learning Gladiator
This is the very first and basic project  working on my github profile.
## Introduction:
In this current technology-driven world, machine learning is a prominent area which makes our machine or electronic device intelligent. The purpose of this field is to transform a simple machine into a machine with the mind. In this article, we explore machine learning and artificial intelligence projects to boost your interest. Because, these AI projects are so competitive, tricky, and interesting to develop. I firmly believe these projects are the best place to invest your time and skill. Let’s move on to analyse this basic project and concepts behind.

### Libraries Included:
-Scipy:The most widely used for analysis and used for simplifying the complex problems.

-Numpy:Usually a linear algebra library. It is much useful for performing mathematical and logical operations. In this project the mattresses of the plots for comparison of various data elements from the data set. We used scatter Matrix for visualising the comparison between different data elements.

-Matplotlib:Of course the plotting tools for a proper visualisation for east of analysing the data,matplotlib is only the only library which gives you the easiest form to visualise or for the pictorial representation of data. In this project too,we will show the different bar charts and  different pictorial representation which will ease to compare and analyse the data given.

-Pandas:We need to have pandas library in a project to import different data sets to predict the materials.

-Sci-kit Learn or SkLearn:Scikit learning is a set of specific algorithms it can transform input data such as text for use with machine learning algorithms.We will discuss about the algorithms used in the project further.

### Algorithms Used:

* Logistic Regression(LR)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
* K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
* Classification and Regression Trees(CART)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes(GNB)
* Support Vextor Machines(SVM)


#### 1.Logistic Regression:
It is a part of supervised learning that has capability of predicting the probability of a targeted variable. The targeted variable in this project is the species as the flowers.

#### 2.Logistic Discriminant Analysis:
This algorithm usually helps in the analysis of pattern or model changes.

#### 3.K-Nearest Neighbor:
K Nearest Neighbor usually used in the classification problems where a particular factor is tourism and all the points nearest to the factor are selected.

#### 4.Classification and Regression Trees:
It explains how a target variable's values can be predicted based on other values. It is a decision tree where each fork is a split in a predictor variable and each node at the end has a prediction for the target variable.

#### 5.Gaussian Naive Bayes :
One of the easiest ways of selecting the most probable hypothesis given the data that we have that we can use as our prior knowledge about the problem. Bayes’ Theorem provides a way that we can calculate the probability of a hypothesis given our prior knowledge.

#### 6.Support Vector Machines:
Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space,we taking n=1,because it is a very basic project I've worked with and taking "species" as key feature.



Here are the steps for building the first random forest model using Scikit-Learn:

1.Set up your environment.

2.Import libraries and modules.

3.Load red wine data.

4.Split data into training and test sets.

5.Declare data preprocessing steps.

6.Declare hyperparameters to tune.

7.Tune model using cross-validation pipeline.

8.Refit on the entire training set.

9.Evaluate model pipeline on test data.

10.Save model for further use.

In this Python Machine Learning Project, I've demonstrated how to use Scikit-Learn to build and tune a supervised learning model.

#### Why Scikit-Learn for machine learning?

Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn, is Python’s premier general-purpose machine learning library. While we find other packages that do better at certain tasks, Scikit-Learn’s versatility makes it the best starting place for most ML problems. It’s also a fantastic library for beginners because it offers a high-level interface for many tasks (e.g. preprocessing data, cross-validation, etc.). This allows us to better practice the entire machine learning workflow and understand the big picture. The goal is to take out-of-the-box models and apply them to different datasets.

#### Objectives:

First, this project has helped build intuition for model-to-problem fit. Which models are robust to missing data? Which models handle categorical features well? We can learn better by seeing it in action.

Second, this project taught me the invaluable skill of prototyping models quickly. In the real world, it’s often difficult to know which model will perform best without simply trying them.

Finally, this exercise helped me master the workflow of model building.

It also helped me practice:

-Importing data

-Cleaning data

-Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets

-Pre-processing

-Transformations

-Feature engineering
